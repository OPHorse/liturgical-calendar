    <h1>Lent</h1>
    <p>Lent is a season to reflect on Jesus and what He has done for us.</p>
    <p>We practice Lent to remember God's love for us through Jesus. He has died on the cross for our sins and we should thank Him.</p>
    <p>It starts on Ash Wednesday and ends on Maundy Thursday. During this time we must reflect, fast, volunteer and attend Ash Wednesday.</p>
