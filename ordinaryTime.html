    <h1>Ordinary Time</h1>
    <br>
        <p>Ordinary Time doesn't mean that it is ordinary. Just like every season it is important.</p>
        <p>It is called Ordinary which refers to the Latin word <i>"ordo"</i> or order which means that the weeks are numbered.</p>
        <p>Ordinary Time is divided into two parts and varies for every year.</p>
        <p>It is the time to be focused on ourselves so that we may become better people.</p>
